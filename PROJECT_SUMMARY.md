# TP_API_WRAPPER Project Summary

## Last Updated: 2025-08-01

### What We Accomplished Today:

1. **Fixed Order Book Issues**
   - Identified and resolved field name mismatches (bids/asks vs bidLevels/askLevels)
   - Fixed venue code and route fields not being returned (needed optional_fields parameter)
   - Cleaned models to only include fields that API actually returns
   - Ensured testing on weekdays during trading hours

2. **Project Cleanup**
   - Removed all test files except comprehensive test
   - Cleaned up test result directories
   - Organized project structure

3. **Git Repository Setup**
   - Created dedicated git repository for TP_API_WRAPPER project
   - Added proper .gitignore for Python projects
   - Made initial commit with all project files
   - Isolated from parent directory git issues

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive Jupyter notebook tutorial (Trayport_API_Client_Tutorial.ipynb)
   - Includes all endpoints with working examples
   - User only needs to add API key
   - Covers best practices and common use cases

### Current Project Status:
- ✅ All core functionality working
- ✅ Order book data returning complete information
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite passing
- ✅ Git repository properly initialized
- ✅ Tutorial documentation created

### Key Technical Details:

#### Order Book Fields That Work:
- **OrderBookTop**: timestamp, bid_price, bid_quantity, ask_price, ask_quantity, bid_venue_code, ask_venue_code
- **OrderBookLevel**: price, quantity, venue_code, route
- **OrderBookSnapshot**: timestamp, bids (list), asks (list)

#### Important API Constraints:
- Order book queries must be for single contracts only
- Maximum date ranges: 32 days for trades, 60 days for order book
- Rate limits: 6 req/sec, 360 req/min (client handles automatically)
- Weekend data: No order book data on weekends (markets closed)

### Potential Future Enhancements:
- Data export utilities (CSV/Parquet) with proper formatting
- Advanced data transformations for analysis
- PyPI packaging (if needed for wider distribution)

### Files to Reference:
- `examples/comprehensive_api_test.py` - Full test suite
- `examples/real_usage_example.py` - Practical usage patterns
- `Trayport_API_Client_Tutorial.ipynb` - Complete documentation
- `trayport_client/models/orders.py` - Fixed order book models

The project is now fully functional and ready for production use. The order book issues have been completely resolved, and the client successfully retrieves all types of data from the Trayport API.
